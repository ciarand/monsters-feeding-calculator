Monsters Feeding Calculator
===========================
This project is a very simple CLI app built on [Cilex][] (which in turn is
built on [Symfony][] components) that calculates the food cost of raising a
monster in [My Singing Monsters][] to a certain level.

[Cilex]: http://cilex.github.io/
[Symfony]: http://symfony.com
[My Singing Monsters]: http://www.mysingingmonsters.com/home/

Why?
----
Good question. This is an experiment with [Cilex][] (and thus
[Symfony Console][]), as well as an experiment in writing namespaced, testable
classes.

I also wasn't sure how much food my Entbrat would take to get to level 15.

[Symfony Console]: symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/index.html

Installation
------------
1. Git clone the project
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ciarand/monsters-feeding-calculator
```
2. Use [composer][] to install the dependencies
```bash
composer install
```
3. Run the app
```bash
php app.php --from-level 1 --to-level 15 --current-food-cost 15
```

[composer]: http://getcomposer.org/

Output
------
```bash
+-------+--------------------+------------+

```

Testing
-------
To run the test suite, install the `--dev` dependencies (currently Composer
does this by default, but that behavior may change) and run PHPUnit from the
root directory.
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
Output:
```bash
❯ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
PHPUnit 3.7.25 by Sebastian Bergmann.

Configuration read from {REDACTED}/monsters-feeding-utility/phpunit.xml
